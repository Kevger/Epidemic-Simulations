        >Epidemics can be modelled mathematically in order to make forecasts
        and, if necessary, take countermeasures in time. First and foremost is
        the mathematical model developed in 1927 by William Ogilvy Kermack &
        Anderson Gray McKendrick, which divides the population into three
        groups: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) and also models
        the interactions between them. According to Robert J. Shiller,
        successful narratives run like epidemics and also possess
        characteristics of pathogens such as the risk of infection, incubation
        period or recovery rate. The simulations presented here can be used to
        model both narratives and biological epidemics.</v-card-text
